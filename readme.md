Please use the file Comparing Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests.pdf to view the paper.

## Description
The goals of this project was to practice technical writing, learn LaTex, and introduce myself to reading statistic papers.
This was originally a short paper I wrote as a final project to one of my classes.
I chose a simple topic that I had interest in and had a lot of fun writing the paper.
I also was able to learn how to cite other papers in LaTex using Overleaf as an IDE.

I also included a few small assignments from that class that include smaller writing projects.
These include topics such as reproducible research, data copyright, and what makes a good graph.

## Skills:
- Researching Statistical Methods
- Applying information from Research Papers
- Citing Papers

## Tools
- LaTex using Overleaf IDE
- BibTeX
- Rmarkdown

## Improvements and Retrospective Conclusion
A great addition I would like to make to the paper is to add some coding examples and integrate them into the paper.
 This would add a great visual interpretation of the results I discuss in the paper

Overall, this paper was a lot of fun to write. The thing I enjoyed the most was gathering information from research papers to cite in the paper.
I also enjoyed the technical writing aspect of the paper, like trying to make the information concise and easy to read.
Since I loved working on this project so much I plan on writing about a different topic in the future.
